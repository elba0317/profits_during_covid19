<p> As the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered bars and restaurants across the world in 2020, food delivery companies directly profited from their loss. Companies like GrubHub, UberEats and HelloFresh more than doubled their normal yearly revenue increase. </p>

<p>Scott L. Newbert, director of the Lawrence N. Field programs in Entrepneurship at Baruch College says, "I would expect demand for these companies to decrease over time now that restaurants are reopening . . . However, people have grown accustomed to the convenience of the service, and to the extent that this has changed consumer behavior, then demand for the industry as a whole might not fall all the way back." Newbert adds, "Of course no one knows what will really happen," in reference to the next pandemic, natural disaster or whatever factor may tip the scales in the future. </p>
